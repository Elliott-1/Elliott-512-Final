    "## Example 4. Convert points between geodetic coordinate systems\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the constraints in doing geodetic computations is that most of the time we need to have our points (the coordinates for places) in the same geographic coordinate system. There are tons and tons of coordinate systems. You can find descriptions of many of them at [EPSG.io](https://epsg.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the wildfire header information, you can find this in the output of Example 1 (above), we can see fields named \"geometryType\" and \"spatialReference\". This looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "        \"geometryType\": \"esriGeometryPolygon\",\n",
    "        \"spatialReference\": {\n",
    "            \"wkid\": 102008,\n",
    "            \"latestWkid\": 102008\n",
    "        },\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that the geometry of our wildfire data are generic polygons and that they are expressed in a coordinate system with the well-known ID (WKID) 102008. This coordinate system is also known as [ESRI:102008](https://epsg.io/102008)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look back at Example 2 (above), you might have wondered about the line of code that says:\n",
    "\n",
    "    geocalc = Geod(ellps='WGS84')         # Use WGS84 ellipsoid representation of the earth\n",
    "\n",
    "That string, 'WGS84', is a representation of the earth, that also relies on a well known coordinate system that is sometimes called 'decimal degrees' (DD). That decimal degrees system has an official name (or WKID) of [EPSG:4326](https://epsg.io/4326).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the example below, what we're going to do is take the geometry of a fire feature, extract the largest ring (i.e., the largest boundary of the fire) and convert all of the points in that ring from the ESRI:102008 coordinate system to EPSG:4326 coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? You might ask. Well, it turns out that the easy way to get locations for a city is to make a Google query for the location. That will respond with a decimal degress version of latitued and longitude. So, this allows us to move everything into decimal degress before we perform a distance calcluation.\n"

    "The basic problem is knowing how far away a fire is from some location (like a city). One issue is that fires are irregularly shaped so the actual answer to that is a bit dependent upon the exact shape and how you want to think about the notion of 'distance'. For example, should we just find the closest point on the perimiter of a fire and call that the distance? Maybe we should find the centroid of the region, identify that as a geolocation (coordinate) and then calculate the distance to that? We can come up with numerous other ways.\n",
